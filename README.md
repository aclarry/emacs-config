# emacs-config

Elisp configuration I use for Emacs

A lot of things are WIP, but I personally am pretty happy with the python settings
I've settled on.

The helper script `emacs-config.py` should work in python 2 or 3.

Running `emacs-config.py install` will install the backed up configuration from the
`backup/` directory into the home directory.

Running `emacs-config.py update` will update the backed up configuration using the
configuration from the user's home directory.
